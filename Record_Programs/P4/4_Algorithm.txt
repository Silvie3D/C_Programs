1. Begin with `head = NULL` to mark an empty linked list.
2. Insert operations create a node with `data` and adjust its `next` link so it fits at the beginning, end, or at a chosen position after moving to the correct spot.
3. Delete operations remove the node whose `data` is to be deleted—either the first, the last, or the one at a specific position—while updating surrounding `next` links.
4. Display starts at `head` and prints each node’s `data`, or reports the list is empty.
5. A menu repeatedly allows insert, delete, display, or exit.
6. End the program.
