1. Start the program. Define a `Node` structure with `data` and `next`; set `head = NULL`.
2. Insert at beginning: create a node, set its `next` to `head`, update `head`.
3. Insert at end: create a node; if list empty set `head`; else traverse to last and link it.
4. Insert at position: if pos = 1 use beginning insertion; else traverse to (pos-1) and link new node.
5. Delete first: if empty show message; else move `head` to `head->next` and free old node.
6. Delete last: if empty show message; if one node free it and set `head=NULL`; else traverse to second last, delete last.
7. Delete at position: if pos = 1 delete first; else traverse to (pos-1), unlink target node, free it.
8. Display list: if empty print message; else traverse from head printing data.
9. In `main()`, show menu for all insert/delete/display operations and execute choices until Exit.
10. End program.
