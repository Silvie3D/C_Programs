1. Start with an empty queue by setting both `head` and `tail` to NULL.
2. To enqueue, create a new node; if the queue is empty attach it as the first node, otherwise link it after the tail and update the tail.
3. To dequeue, check if the queue is empty; if not, remove the front node, move `head` forward, and clear `tail` if the queue becomes empty.
4. To display, either report that the queue is empty or print all values from head to tail.
5. Show a menu offering enqueue, dequeue, display, and exit options, and perform the selected action.
6. Repeat the menu until the user chooses to exit.
7. End the program.
