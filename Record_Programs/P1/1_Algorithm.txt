1. Start program at main() and declare integer variables n1 and n2 to hold the sizes of the two arrays.
2. Prompt the user for the size of the first array and read the value into n1.
3. Prompt the user for the size of the second array and read the value into n2.
4. Declare three local arrays: arr1 of length n1, arr2 of length n2, and merged of length n1 + n2.
5. Call insertArray(arr1, n1) which asks the user for n1 integers and stores them sequentially into arr1.
6. Call insertArray(arr2, n2) which asks the user for n2 integers and stores them sequentially into arr2.
7. Call sortArray(arr1, n1) which applies bubble sort to reorder arr1 in ascending order.
8. Call sortArray(arr2, n2) which applies bubble sort to reorder arr2 in ascending order.
9. Call mergeArrays(arr1, n1, arr2, n2, merged) which walks through both sorted arrays, compares current elements, copies the smaller into merged, and advances the corresponding indices until one array is exhausted.
10. Continue copying any remaining elements from the non-exhausted array into merged so that all elements from both arrays are included in sorted order.
11. Print the message "Merged sorted array:" and then iterate through merged from index 0 to n1 + n2 - 1, printing each element separated by spaces.
12. End program
