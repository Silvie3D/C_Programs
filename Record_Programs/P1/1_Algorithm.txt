1. Start the program. Read sizes `n1` and `n2`.
2. Declare arrays `arr1[n1]`, `arr2[n2]`, and `merged[n1+n2]`.
3. Input elements into `arr1` and `arr2`.
4. Sort both arrays using bubble sort.
5. Merge the two sorted arrays into `merged` by comparing elements until one array ends, then append the remaining elements.
6. Print all elements of the merged array.
7. End.
