1. Start the program. Read the number of nodes and input the adjacency matrix containing the edge weights.
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited, then mark the first node as visited to start the MST.
3. Initialize a counter to track how many edges have been added to the MST.
4. While the number of selected edges is less than `n − 1`, search through all visited nodes and look for the smallest-weight edge that connects to any unvisited node.
5. When the minimum such edge is found, print it as part of the MST.
6. Mark the newly connected node as visited.
7. Increase the edge counter and repeat the process.
8. Stop when `n − 1` edges have been chosen, completing the minimum spanning tree.
9. End the program.
