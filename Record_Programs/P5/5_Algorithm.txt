1. Start the program. Define a `Node` structure with `data` and `next`; set `head = NULL`.
2. `push()`: create a new node with user data, `next = NULL`; if list empty set `head`, else traverse to last and link it.
3. `pop()`: if empty print message; if one node print and delete it; otherwise traverse to second-last, delete last, and set its `next` to NULL.
4. `display()`: if empty print message; else traverse from head and print all values.
5. In `main()`, show menu: Push, Pop, Display, Exit.
6. Based on user choice, call the corresponding function or exit; otherwise show “Invalid choice.”
7. Loop menu until Exit.
8. End program.
