1. Start the program and read the number of nodes and input the adjacency matrix of the graph.
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited initially.
3. Read the starting node for the BFS traversal.
4. Mark the starting node as visited and insert it into the queue.
5. While the queue is not empty, remove the front node and print it.
6. For that node, check every adjacent node; if it is connected and unvisited, mark it visited and add it to the queue.
7. Repeat this process until all reachable nodes from the starting node have been processed.
8. End the program.
