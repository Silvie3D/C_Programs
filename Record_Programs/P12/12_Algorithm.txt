1. Start the program. Read the number of nodes and input the adjacency matrix containing all edge weights.
2. Initialize the parent array so every node is its own parent.
3. Initialize an edge counter to keep track of how many edges have been added to the MST.
4. While the number of selected edges is less than `n − 1`, search the entire adjacency matrix to find the smallest-weight edge that connects two nodes belonging to different sets (their parents differ).
5. When such an edge is found, record its endpoints and its weight.
6. Join the two sets of these endpoints using the union operation.
7. Print the selected edge as part of the MST.
8. Mark this edge as used by setting its weight to a large value, and increase the edge counter before repeating the process.
9. End the program.
