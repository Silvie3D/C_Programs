1. Start with an empty queue marked by `front` and `rear` both at -1.
2. To enqueue, check if the queue is full; if not, add the new value at the rear and set front if it’s the first element.
3. To dequeue, check if the queue is empty; if not, remove the front element and adjust pointers.
4. To display, show all elements from front to rear or state that the queue is empty.
5. Repeatedly offer options to enqueue, dequeue, display, or exit until the user chooses to stop.
6. End the program.
