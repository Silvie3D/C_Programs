1. Start the program by creating an empty stack and setting a variable to track the top position.
2. Provide a push operation that adds a new value if space allows, and a pop operation that removes the most recent value if the stack isn’t empty.
3. Allow the stack contents to be displayed, showing items from top to bottom or indicating that it’s empty.
4. In the main flow, ask for the stack’s size, then repeatedly offer a menu to push, pop, view the stack, or exit.
5. Perform the chosen action until the user decides to stop.
6. End the program.
