1. Start the program and read the total number of vertices in the graph.
2. Input the adjacency matrix that defines which vertices are connected.
3. Initialize all vertices as unvisited.
4. Read the starting vertex for the DFS traversal.
5. Begin DFS at the starting vertex by marking it as visited.
6. Print the current vertex.
7. From the current vertex, check every other vertex; if there is an edge and that vertex is unvisited, recursively apply DFS on it.
8. Continue this process until all connected vertices have been explored.
9. End the program.
