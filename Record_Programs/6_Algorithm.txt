Step 1: Start the program and define a structure called Node containing two members — an integer data field and a pointer next to store the address of the next node.

Step 2: Initialize head and tail pointers to NULL to indicate that the queue is empty.

Step 3: Create a function enqueue() to insert a new element at the end of the linked list. Allocate memory for a new node and store the data entered by the user. Set the node’s next pointer to NULL. If the queue is empty, make both head and tail point to the new node. Otherwise, link the current tail’s next pointer to the new node and update tail to the new node. Print that the element has been enqueued.

Step 4: Create a function dequeue() to remove an element from the beginning of the linked list. If head is NULL, print “Queue is empty.” Otherwise, store head in a temporary pointer, print the dequeued value, move head to the next node, and free the temporary node. If head becomes NULL after deletion, set tail to NULL as well.

Step 5: Create a function display() to show all elements in the queue. If head is NULL, print “Queue is empty.” Otherwise, traverse from head to the end and print all node values.

Step 6: In main(), display a menu with options such as Enqueue, Dequeue, Display and Exit.

Step 7: If user chooses:
        Option 1 → call enqueue() function to insert element at end.
        Option 2 → call dequeue() function to remove element from beginning.
        Option 3 → call display() function to view queue contents.
        Option 4 → exit the program.
        Otherwise, print “Invalid choice.”

Step 8: Repeat Step 7 until the user selects Exit.

Step 9: End the program.
