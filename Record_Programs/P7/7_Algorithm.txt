1. Begin with an empty doubly linked list by setting both `head` and `tail` to NULL.
2. To insert at the beginning, create a new node, link it before the current head, and update head (and tail if the list was empty).
3. To insert at the end, create a new node, attach it after the tail, and update tail (or set both head and tail if the list was empty).
4. To insert at a specific position, handle position 1 as a beginning insertion; otherwise, move to the correct spot, validate, and link the new node in place, updating tail if it becomes the last node.
5. To delete from the beginning, ensure the list isn’t empty, remove the head node, move head forward, and adjust pointers (reset tail if the list becomes empty).
6. To delete from the end, ensure the list isn’t empty, remove the tail node, move tail backward, and adjust pointers (reset head if the list becomes empty).
7. To delete from a specific position, treat position 1 as a beginning deletion; otherwise, locate the node before the target, validate, unlink the node, adjust neighbors, and update tail if necessary.
8. To display, either state the list is empty or print elements from head to tail.
9. Present a menu offering all insert, delete, and display operations, along with an exit option.
10. Perform the selected action or show an error for invalid choices.
11. Continue the menu until the user chooses to exit.
12. End the program.
